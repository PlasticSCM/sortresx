sortresx
========

Sorts alphabetically a .resx XML file.

Usage:

sortresx resources_file.resx

This program reads the resx file content and writes it sorting the resources strings alphabetically.

This is very useful when merging resx files that have been changed in depth: since the contributors are sorted,
conflicts only arise if there are conflicts in the SAME localization strings.
